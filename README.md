A TypeScript implementation of the [Hopcroft-Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopcroft%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) for finding maximum bipartite matchings, with special focus on perfect matchings in [bipartite graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph).

## üìã Features

- ‚úÖ Finds maximum matchings in bipartite graphs
- ‚úÖ Determines if a perfect matching exists
- ‚úÖ Handles various edge cases (empty graphs, isolated vertices, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Written in TypeScript with full type safety
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite
- ‚úÖ Robust error handling

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun install

# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install
```

## üîç Algorithm Overview

The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm finds a maximum matching in a bipartite graph with time complexity O(E‚àöV), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. This is more efficient than the traditional augmenting path algorithms which run in O(VE) time.

Key concepts:
- **Bipartite Graph**: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in the first set to one in the second set.
- **Matching**: A set of edges without common vertices.
- **Maximum Matching**: A matching with the largest possible number of edges.
- **Perfect Matching**: A matching that covers all vertices in the graph (only possible when both partitions have the same size).

## üìä Usage

```typescript
import { createBipartiteGraph, HopcroftKarp } from './hopkroft-karp';

// Create a bipartite graph
const graph = createBipartiteGraph(
  3, // leftSize - number of nodes in the left partition
  3, // rightSize - number of nodes in the right partition
  [
    [0, 0], [0, 1], // Edges from left node 0 to right nodes 0 and 1
    [1, 1], [1, 2], // Edges from left node 1 to right nodes 1 and 2
    [2, 0], [2, 2]  // Edges from left node 2 to right nodes 0 and 2
  ]
);

// Create a Hopcroft-Karp instance
const hk = new HopcroftKarp(graph);

// Find a maximum matching
const maximumMatching = hk.findMaximumMatching();
console.log('Maximum matching size:', maximumMatching.size);
console.log('Left matches:', maximumMatching.matchLeft);
console.log('Right matches:', maximumMatching.matchRight);

// Try to find a perfect matching (returns null if none exists)
const perfectMatching = hk.findPerfectMatching();
if (perfectMatching) {
  console.log('Perfect matching found!');
} else {
  console.log('No perfect matching exists.');
}
```

## üìò API

### `createBipartiteGraph(leftSize, rightSize, edges, options?)`

Creates a bipartite graph representation.

- **leftSize**: Number of nodes in the left partition
- **rightSize**: Number of nodes in the right partition
- **edges**: Array of `[leftNode, rightNode]` pairs representing edges
- **options** (optional):
  - **validateInput**: Whether to validate input (default: `true`)
  - **skipInvalidEdges**: Whether to skip invalid edges instead of throwing (default: `true`)

### `class HopcroftKarp`

- **constructor(graph)**: Creates a new instance with the given bipartite graph
- **findMaximumMatching()**: Finds a maximum matching in the graph
- **findPerfectMatching()**: Finds a perfect matching if one exists, otherwise returns `null`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development

## üîÑ Algorithm Visualization

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

```
Given bipartite graph G = (U, V, E):

1. Initialize empty matching M
2. Repeat until no augmenting path is found:
   a. Use BFS to find the shortest augmenting path P
   b. If no augmenting path exists, return M as the maximum matching
   c. Find a maximal set of disjoint augmenting paths P1, P2, ..., Pk
   d. Augment M using all paths in the set (M = M ‚äï (P1 ‚à™ P2 ‚à™ ... ‚à™ Pk))
3. Return M as the maximum matching

* Augmenting path: A path that starts and ends with unmatched vertices and alternates
  between edges in the matching and edges not in the matching.
* Augmentation: The symmetric difference between the current matching and an augmenting path,
  which increases the size of the matching by 1.
```

## üìö Applications

Bipartite matching has numerous applications, including:

- üëî Assignment problems (assigning workers to jobs)
- üéì University admission matching
- üè• Organ donor matching
- üß† Network flow problems
- üîç Pattern matching in images
- üóÑÔ∏è Database record deduplication
